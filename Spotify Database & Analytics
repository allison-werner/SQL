--In this example, I downloaded a .csv spreadsheet with information on Spotify's Top 50 songs from Kaggle.
--Then I created a table to import the data into.
--Next I analyzed the data by running different SQL queries.

#Creating the table:

key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
