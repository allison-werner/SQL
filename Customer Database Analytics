In this SQL, I am querying a database with multiple tables in order to answer questions about customer and order data.

--How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(OrderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(OrderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone';

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT (acctnum) FROM BIT_DB.customers customer
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales FEB
ON customer.order_id=FEB.orderID;

--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1;

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

ELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT Product, sum(Quantity), SUM(Quantity)*Price AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT count(acctnum), avg(quantity)*price AS Avg_Spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FEB
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers Customers
ON Customers.order_id=FEB.orderID
WHERE Quantity>2
